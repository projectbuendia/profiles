# profiles

This repo contains Buendia "profiles", which are CSV files that
define the forms and the chart layout in the Buendia app.

Upon first cloning this repo, please execute "./init" to set up
the git hooks, which will produce a version-named copy of each
.csv file in the "uploads" directory for easy uploading.
